I use a few images, found on the Internet, in my slides. Although
I'm not a copyright expert, I believe that my use of these images
here constitutes fair use:

"[...] the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by
reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified
by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news
reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use),
scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use

On the other hand, re-distribution of the materials may very well not
be considered "fair use". I'm including the graphics and images I use
in this repository so as to make it easy for anybody else to use them
for "fair use" purposes only, and I'm explicitly noting them to not be
under my copyright nor licensed as my materials are.

If you are the owner of such material and would like to have me remove
it, please just let me know.
